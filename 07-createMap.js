/*
Return an array containing the results of applying a callback to each element in an array.

Does this sound familiar? It should. Your job is basically to build the array method MAP.

Note: Do NOT use map to solve this! That's cheating!
Feel free to use any other array method if you so desire.

Example:
// This is our callback
var addOne = (num) => {
  return num + 1;
};

myMap([1, 2, 3], addOne);
--> Returns [2, 3, 4]

*/

const myMap = (array, callback) => {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
};
